# assignment 

    1.**class** : is offline model of an object, it also hold the interested variable or parameters for the object&its methods (actions done by it or actions done on it).
    
    2.simply by using interface to use this class (public functions) so if any developer want to use my class he doesn't have to deal with the complexity of the object just the interface only (as example the PC user doesn't have to deal with the code and how the system works only his interest to use another application on the operating system, so you can use any class code without interfere in its details and how is it works and on the user interface (public function) class can restrict some actions or values to be used or entered to prevent crash or for security issue or authority issue.
  
    3.like the relation between data type and variable so object is the variable and class is the data type.


    4.data member is specific for each variable, but the function all objects from the same class have to use the same functions (same method for all objects). 

5.class account {
    
    private:
        string name ;
        float balance;
        string number;
    
    public :
        account (string ana , float abal ,string anum );
        account (string ana ,string anum );
        float deposit (float amount);
        float withdraw (float amount);
        void check_acc ();
        float get_balance();
        string get_name();
        string get_number();

};

    6.constructor called when initializing an object from the class and destructor is called when terminating the object (ex: if the object initialized is sub function is the main)

7.Two constructor:

        account::account (string ana , float abal ,string anum ){
        name =ana;
        balance =abal;
        number =anum;
        }
    
    account:: account (string ana ,string anum ){
        name =ana;
        balance =300;
        number =anum;
        }
        
    8.if the class  name is one the default constructor one () it's a privilege from C++ so you don't have to implement one&it doesn't take arguments.

    10.this: it reference to object (for using inside the object only as you can return this). *this is the variables itself (so if you return *this you will take copy of the object inner us only as this)
